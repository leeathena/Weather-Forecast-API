# Weather-Forecast-API
I used the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities and created a web page to present these data

## Key features
This is a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  - When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  - When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    - The city name
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
    - The wind speed
  - When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
  - When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
